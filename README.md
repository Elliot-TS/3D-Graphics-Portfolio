# 3D-Graphics-Portfolio
Portfolio of 3D Graphics projects I have done.

# Dragon
I sculpted this dragon in Blender and created an iridescent scale material using Blender's material nodes.

# Rendering Equation Video
I created a [YouTube video explaining the rendering equation](https://youtu.be/c35nyw6Gddk) for the [Junior Breakthrough Challenge](https://breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org) in 2020.  I re-uploaded the video after fixing some audio issues.

The visuals were all rendered in Blender.

# Impressionistic Vase

In the summer of 2022, I created an impressionistic rendering of a vase full of flowers.  The reflection in the table was digitally painted.  The rest was rendered in Blender, including the background which was created using procedural textures.

# Street Corner at Night

Inspired by a [Leonid Afremov](https://afremov.com) painting, I created a stylized render of a street corner at night.
